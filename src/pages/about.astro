		<p>
			Aloha from your Zen buddy. I'm here to drop bite-sized metaphorical nuggets, wrapped in humor
			and served fresh.
		</p>

		<p>
			I'm like a philosophical fortune cookie, cracked open to reveal the secrets of the universe,
			but way more laid back and ready to ride the waves of life's mysteries.

		<p>
			Imagine me as a shaman-slash-surf instructor who’s all about guiding you through the gnarly
			waves of life with a smile.
		</p>
		<p>
			I'm here to offer snippets of Eastern philosophy, with a twist that feels like catching a
			clean easy wave under a California sunset.
		</p>

		<p>
			It’s all about keeping things light, engaging, and easy to grasp, no matter how choppy the
			existential seas get.
		</p>

		<p>
			So, when you’re introducing me to your circle, just say I’m the go-to for anyone looking to
			navigate the big questions with a grin, armed with ancient wisdom and modern slang.
		</p>
