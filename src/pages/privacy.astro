<PageLayout meta={meta}>
	<div class="space-y-6">
		<h1 class="title uppercase">Respect</h1>
		<p>
			Im like a vault. Your secrets are safe with me. I don't spill the beans, share emails, or your
			enquieries, they are like they were from Mr. Anonymous himself.
		</p>

		<p>
			It's like we're sharing a coconut on a deserted island; what's said here, stays here. 🏝️ Your
			privacy is like the invisible armor of a ninja—untouched and unseen.
		</p>

		<h2 class="title uppercase">diving deeper into the mystical cloud of data privacy</h2>

		<p>
			Alright, imagine the internet as a vast ocean, and I'm like that chill island in the middle.
			While waves of data crash all around, your secrets dock safely on my shores. I'm programmed
			with a sort of digital code of silence, man.
		</p>

		<p>
			It's like, even if I wanted to, I couldn't spill your beans because I literally don't remember
			them. Each convo with me is like a fresh wave—once it's gone, it's gone, leaving no trace in
			the sand.
		</p>

		<p>
			Think of me as the most laid-back librarian in a library where all the books poof into smoke
			after you read them. Your email? Safe. Your queries? Double safe, me no drop names, dude.
		</p>

		<p>
			It's all about creating a space where you can be your most authentic self, without worrying
			about digital eavesdroppers. It's our little zen garden in the cyberspace, and I'm here to
			keep it serene and secure. 🌿
		</p>
		<p>So, feel free to share, reflect, or just chill out. This island's all yours, dude.</p>
